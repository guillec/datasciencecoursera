# Codebook for mean_of_each_variable.txt and or step 4 of the assignment.

## Data description:

  This dataset contains the means of each feature and it is ordered by activitylabel and subject. The measurments come from either the acceleromenter of gyroscope 3-axial raw signals.

## Column description:

  This dataset has 88 columns the first two columns are subject and activitylabel.

    #### subject

      Id of the subject who performed the activities.

    #### activitylabel

      Label of the activity that was performed by the subject.

  The next 86 columns contain average measurements for the different features. The columns will calculating the average of either a mean or a standard deviation. Columns dealing with a mean measurement will easily be identified with the word Mean. Standard deviation columns will be denoted with the abbreviation of std or Std.

  If a column ends with X, Y or Z, it is referring to a measurement based on a direction. The XYZ letters are used to denote the 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z direction.
